You can find it here: https://github.com/Infinite-Improbability/math322-inverse-theory\n\nMy experience, as discussed, is in Python. However, I decided that if I'm going to be doing a lot of matrix work I'd use something with native support and better performance. MatLab is, of course, great with matrices but I prefer something a bit more open. Enter Julia, which is both fast and designed with linear algebra and scientific computing in mind.
